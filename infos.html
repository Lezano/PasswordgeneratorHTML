  <h1>SecureKeyGen: Your Truly Offline Password Generator and Manager</h1>
  <p>Tired of worrying about your passwords being stored on remote servers or vulnerable to online hacks? <strong>SecureKeyGen</strong> is here to provide you with peace of mind!</p>

  <p>With <strong>SecureKeyGen</strong>, all your passwords are generated and managed <strong>entirely offline</strong>, ensuring maximum privacy and security. Your data is stored solely in your browser's <strong>local storage</strong>, meaning it never leaves your device.</p>

  <h2>Why Choose SecureKeyGen?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>True Offline Security:</strong> No internet dependency; your sensitive data stays on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Passwords are stored directly in your browser's secure local storage, not on third-party servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Convenient Management:</strong> Generate and retrieve strong, unique passwords for all your accounts in seconds.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Important Note:</strong> As <strong>SecureKeyGen</strong> relies on your device's local storage, itâ€™s crucial to back up your data. If you clear your browser's cache or switch devices without exporting your passwords, your saved data will be permanently lost.
